## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can be caused by various types of behavior, and prevention efforts aim to address and eliminate these behaviors. Here are some common types of behavior that can contribute to sexual harassment and some prevention measures:

- Unwanted sexual advances: This includes making unwelcome sexual propositions, advances, or requests. Prevention involves promoting clear communication about boundaries, consent, and respectful relationships.

- Verbal harassment: Making sexually explicit comments, jokes, or using sexually suggestive language. Prevention involves fostering a culture of respect and professionalism, providing education on appropriate workplace or social conduct, and encouraging bystander intervention.

- Physical harassment: Unwanted physical contact of a sexual nature, such as touching, groping, or assault. Prevention measures include establishing and enforcing clear policies against physical harassment, promoting personal boundaries and consent, and providing self-defense training if applicable.

- Non-verbal harassment: Displaying sexually suggestive gestures, leering, or making sexually explicit gestures. Prevention involves creating an environment where non-verbal behaviors that make others uncomfortable are discouraged and educating individuals on respectful non-verbal communication.

- Sexual coercion: Using one's position of power or authority to pressure someone into engaging in sexual activity. Prevention includes establishing strong policies against harassment and abuse of power, promoting a culture of accountability and transparency, and providing training on recognizing and addressing coercion.

- Cyber harassment: Sending unwanted sexual messages, explicit images, or engaging in online stalking or harassment of a sexual nature. Prevention measures include establishing guidelines for online behavior, educating individuals about online harassment, and implementing reporting mechanisms for addressing cyber harassment.

To prevent sexual harassment effectively, organizations, institutions, and communities should consider the following preventive measures:

-  Establish clear policies: Develop and communicate clear policies against sexual harassment, ensuring that all individuals are aware of the expectations and consequences for violating those policies.

-  Education and training: Provide comprehensive education and training programs on sexual harassment awareness, prevention, and bystander intervention. These programs should emphasize consent, respectful communication, and the reporting process.

-  Promote a respectful culture: Foster a culture of respect, equality, and inclusivity where all individuals are treated with dignity and professionalism.

-  Encourage reporting: Establish multiple avenues for reporting incidents of sexual harassment, ensuring confidentiality and protection against retaliation. Encourage individuals to report any incidents promptly.

-  Investigate and address complaints: Take all complaints seriously and conduct thorough and impartial investigations. Implement appropriate disciplinary measures when harassment is substantiated.

-  Support services: Provide support services such as counseling, resources, and helplines for individuals who experience or witness sexual harassment.

-  Regular reviews and updates: Regularly review and update policies, procedures, and preventive measures to adapt to changing needs and best practices.

By implementing these measures, organizations and communities can work towards preventing sexual harassment, fostering safe environments, and promoting respect and equality for all individuals.
